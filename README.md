### What I learned
Working on the Testimonials Grid Section project helped me strengthen several front-end development skills. Hereâ€™s what I gained from this experience:

âœ… Responsive Grid Layouts: I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes, especially mobile and tablet views.

âœ… Custom Fonts & Web Typography: I implemented custom fonts using @font-face and practiced consistent typography through CSS variables for font sizes and weights.

âœ… CSS Variables for Design Tokens: I used CSS custom properties (variables) to manage colors, spacing, and typography, making the code more scalable and easier to maintain.

âœ… Styling Components Based on Theme: I practiced applying different background and text colors to individual cards to match the design, using utility classes and modifiers.

âœ… Image Positioning and Decorative Elements: I handled background images with precise positioning (like the quotation mark image) to match the given design specifications.

âœ… Clean and Organized HTML/CSS Structure: I focused on semantic HTML and modular CSS structure for better readability and maintainability.

âœ… Media Queries for Responsiveness: I improved my skills in using media queries to switch layout from a single-column (mobile) to a grid layout (tablet and up).


I also used a mobile-first approach when writing the CSS, and it really paid off. By starting with the smallest screen size and progressively enhancing the layout, I was able to ensure a fully responsive design that looks great on all devices â€” from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

### Useful resources

- [Jasoneczek's Profile on Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jasoneczek) - This profile helped me out to know the exact size of the card and padding because my FE Mentor Member is not premium so I dont get the figma file and dont know the exact size and the Jasoneczek's profile helps me alot.
